customVectorfield_movement
==========================
Based on http://www.openprocessing.org/sketch/9651 by Kyle McDonald.

Description
----
This openframeworks application allows the user to define a vectorfield using a normalized radial basis function based on user defined control vectors. It draws particles in the vectorfield using a bilinear interpolation routine. It's not properly timed, so the speed of the particles is dependant upon framerate. Runs at 250fps on a mid range laptop.

Move all control vectors with right mouse button.
